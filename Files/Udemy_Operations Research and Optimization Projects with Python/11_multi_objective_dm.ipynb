    "In our urban transportation planning scenario, we aim to optimize the city's public transportation network by focusing on three main objectives: minimizing travel time, minimizing environmental impact, and minimizing costs. Here's how we can mathematically model these objectives and the constraints we face:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables:**\n",
    "- $x_{ij}$: The number of transportation units (e.g., buses, trains) allocated to route $i$ during time period $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- $t_{ij}$: Average travel time per unit on route $i$ during time period $j$.\n",
    "- $e_{ij}$: Environmental impact per transportation unit on route $i$ during time period $j$, measured in terms of emissions.\n",
    "- $c_{ij}$: Operational cost per transportation unit on route $i$ during time period $j$.\n",
    "- $B$: Total budget available for transportation projects.\n",
    "- $E_{max}$: Maximum allowable environmental impact.\n",
    "- $D_{ij}$: Demand for transportation on route $i$ during time period $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Functions:**\n",
    "1. Minimize Total Travel Time:\n",
    "   $$Z_1 = \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} t_{ij} x_{ij}$$\n",
    "2. Minimize Environmental Impact:\n",
    "   $$Z_2 = \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} e_{ij} x_{ij}$$\n",
    "3. Minimize Costs:\n",
    "   $$Z_3 = \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} c_{ij} x_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "1. Budget Constraint:\n",
    "   $$\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} c_{ij} x_{ij} \\leq B$$\n",
    "2. Environmental Impact Constraint:\n",
    "   $$\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} e_{ij} x_{ij} \\leq E_{max}$$\n",
    "3. Demand Satisfaction:\n",
    "   $$x_{ij} \\geq D_{ij}, \\forall i, j$$\n",
    "4. Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n",
    "   $$x_{ij} \\geq 0 \\text{ and integer}, \\forall i, j$$"
