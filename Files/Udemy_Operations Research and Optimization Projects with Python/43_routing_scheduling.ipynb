    "## Project Scenario: Delivery Fleet Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we tackle a common yet complex problem faced by logistics companies worldwide: optimizing the routes and schedules of a delivery fleet. The scenario involves a company that needs to deliver goods to various locations across a city using a fleet of vehicles. Each vehicle has a limited capacity, and each delivery location has a specific demand that must be met within certain working hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to minimize the total distance traveled by the fleet while ensuring all demands are satisfied and the vehicles do not exceed their capacity or working hours. This involves deciding which vehicle delivers to which location, in what order, and how to schedule these deliveries efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use mathematical modeling to represent this problem, incorporating variables for each decision point, constraints to ensure feasibility, and an objective function to minimize total distance. This model is then solved using an optimization solver, providing a practical solution that the company can implement to reduce costs and improve efficiency."
