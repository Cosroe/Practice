    "# Introduction to Numeric Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric optimization is a branch of mathematics and computer science that focuses on finding the best solution from a set of possible solutions, given certain constraints. It plays a important role in decision-making processes where optimal efficiency, cost reduction, or resource allocation is desired. At its core, numeric optimization involves mathematical models that represent real-world scenarios, allowing us to systematically explore and identify the most favorable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function \n",
    "This is the central component of any optimization problem. It's a mathematical expression that defines what you are trying to optimize. For example, it could be minimizing production costs, maximizing resource utilization, or achieving the highest possible efficiency in a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "These are the variables that influence the outcome of the objective function. In a production optimization scenario, decision variables could include the amount of raw materials used, production speeds, or temperatures at which materials are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "Constraints are the limitations or requirements that must be satisfied in the optimization problem. They can include budget limits, resource availability, or specific operational boundaries that cannot be crossed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Optimization Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of numeric optimization typically involves defining the objective function, identifying decision variables, setting constraints, and then using mathematical algorithms to find the optimal solution. This solution represents the best possible outcome within the defined constraints."

    "# Scenario : Optimizing Copper Wire Production\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explore the application of numeric optimization in the manufacturing sector, focusing on a factory that produces copper wire.
