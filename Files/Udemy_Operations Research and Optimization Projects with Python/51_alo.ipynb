    "### Straight Assembly Line Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this optimization problem is to minimize the number of open stations while ensuring that tasks are assigned to stations such that the cycle time is not exceeded and the precedence constraints are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables:\n",
    "- $x_{ik}$: Binary variable, 1 if task $i$ is assigned to station $k$, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- $z_k$: Binary variable, 1 if station $k$ is open, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Function:\n",
    "Minimize the number of open stations:\n",
    "$$ \\text{Minimize} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} z_k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Assignment Constraint:** Each task must be assigned to exactly one station.\n",
    "   $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{K} x_{ik} = 1 \\quad \\forall i $$\n",

    "   $$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i \\cdot x_{ik} \\leq C \\cdot z_k \\quad \\forall k $$\n",

    "3. **Precedence Constraint:** Tasks must respect the given precedence relationships, where task $j$ can only start after task $i$ if specified.\n",
    "   $$ x_{ik} \\leq x_{jk} \\quad \\forall (i, j) \\in \\text{Precedence}, \\forall k $$\n",

    "- $i$ and $j$ are indices for tasks,\n",
    "- $k$ is an index for stations,\n",
    "- $t_i$ is the time required to complete task $i$,\n",

    "- $K$ is the total number of stations,\n",
    "- $\\text{Precedence}$ is the set of ordered pairs of tasks $(i, j)$ where task $i$ must precede task $j$.\n"
