    "## Optimization Assignment: Ad Revenue Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Context\n",
    "A new search engine plans to generate revenue by displaying advertisements on personal blogs linked to its site. Companies A, B, and C have decided to advertise only for the following four keywords: \"market\", \"shopping\", \"retail\", and \"cheapness\". Each company has specified the maximum number of sites it can handle and is willing to pay per ad click based on the keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Search Volumes and Payment Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Search Counts:\n",
    "- **Market**: 35,000 searches\n",
    "- **Shopping**: 25,000 searches\n",
    "- **Retail**: 15,000 searches\n",
    "- **Cheapness**: 5,000 searches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Payment Rates per Click (in units):\n",
    "| Company | Market | Shopping | Retail | Cheapness |\n",
    "|---------|--------|----------|--------|-----------|\n",
    "| **A**   | 2      | 3        | 11     | 7         |\n",
    "| **B**   | 1      | 2        | 6      | 1         |\n",
    "| **C**   | 5      | 8        | 15     | 9         |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Capacity Constraints:\n",
    "- **Company A**: Can handle up to 6,000 sites\n",
    "- **Company B**: Can handle up to 2,000 sites\n",
    "- **Company C**: Can handle up to 9,000 sites\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Your task is to maximize the total revenue generated from these ad clicks. Assume that 20% of the searches result in an ad click.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Instructions\n",
    "1. Formulate this problem as a linear programming model.\n",
    "2. Implement the model in Python using `scipy.optimize.linprog`.\n",
    "3. Determine the optimal number of ad displays per keyword for each company.\n",
    "4. Calculate and report the total potential revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Consider the constraints given by each company's capacity and the expected number of ad clicks per keyword.\n",
    "- Your solution should explicitly state the decision variables, the objective function, and the constraints.\n"
